# Letterboxd-Watchlist-Netflix
A simple web app that scrapes a letterboxd watchlist and returns the movies found on Netflix.

Start the server with `npm start` then open in a browser the page `http://localhost:3000/list`
By default it scrapes my watchlist but you can override this by calling `user` as an url parameter: `http://localhost:3000/list?user=username` where `username` is the letterboxd username.
